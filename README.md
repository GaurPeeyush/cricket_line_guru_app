# Sports Betting Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository demonstrates an approach to predict the right time to buy and sell bets using machine learning. Please note that this is a simplified example with a small dataset to maintain simplicity. The aim is to outline the basic workflow, with the understanding that real-world applications require more extensive data and advanced techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used here includes historical odds data for cricket matches. It contains information about the match date, time, team details, initial and final odds, and match outcomes.

## Workflow

The workflow of this project can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection:** A small historical odds dataset is collected.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is prepared, including basic preprocessing and feature engineering.

3. **Model Training:** A logistic regression model is used to predict match outcomes based on odds data.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using standard metrics like accuracy.

5. **Future Directions:** Future work involves applying more advanced machine learning techniques, expanding the dataset, and incorporating time-based analysis to predict precise betting timings.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies.

3. Execute the provided code to work with the sample dataset.

4. For more advanced applications, gather a larger dataset with time-based odds data.
